// Exercise 1
// Create a for loop that logs the numbers 4 to 156 ONLY to the console.



// Exercise 2
// Create an object that holds information on your favourite recipe. Write a loop that prints all values to the console.



// Exercise 3 
// You are provided with an empty array called numArray. Using a for... in loop, fill the array with all of the numbers from the numbers object if they are greater than or equal to 2.

const numbers = {
	num1: 1,
	num2: 2,
	num3: 5,
	num4: 18
  };
  
const numArray = [];



// Exercise 4:
// Write a for loop that will iterate from 0 to 10. For each iteration of the for loop, it should multiply the number by 9 and log the result (e.g. "2 * 9 = 18").
              

  
// Exercise 5: 
// Loop through the following object. Log the data to the console as an array of arrays in the following format: [[key, value], [key,value]] etc. Hint: you can use Google if you get stuck ;)

const studentPopulation = {
  science: 25,
  geography: 15,
  history: 10,
  music: 22
}
